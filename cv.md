### Next, about myself:

Compared to others (_adults and already succesful in their fields_), i'm totally in the beginning of this tough but exciting journey. When i graduated from high school, i decided to not throw myself under the first random faculty of the first random university. Well... In other words, i decided to take a break due my preoccupation with a future profession and bad mental health. Fortunately, after some time my severe depression was defeated but i still was in dismay. More than a year ago my interests was primarly _not-technical-at-all_. I wanted to find my true self in arts or foreign languages. But, sooner or later, it simply became annoying and after all didn't bring any exhaust.

But it will be lie, if i say, that i didn't watch over STEM. I remember, that i had an attempt to join the IT-sphere. My poor unprepared head was boiling under the attack of Python's basics. It's no wonder, this studying process was shut down. At that moment, my thoughts were dismal.

> I never can do this... That's too much.

After many months, to my joy now, i cooled off. And... Started again, but now from HTML/CSS + JavaScript. It was ***mine***. I never felt this kind of excitement and interest in something before. Finally, this was a feeling of the ground under my feet.

> I really want to know all of this stuff! I should try hard and be persistent, and everything will be alright!

So, i don't have any work experience or finished projects, but i do have a big hope in future and desire to work as hard as possible. That's the one of important parts of the whole success picture.

    a = parseInt(a);
    b = parseInt(b);
    
    var c = a + b;
    alert("Сумма двух чисел: " + c);
    
    c = a * b;
    alert("Произведение двух чисел: " + c);
    
    c = a / b;
    alert("Деление двух чисел: " + c);
    
    c = (a + b) / 2;
    alert("Среднее арифметическое двух чисел: " + c);
